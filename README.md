# Advanced-One-in-the-Chamber-Mode
A more advanced version of One in the Chamber which allows weapons to be selected in game.

I made this for a bit of fun with my platoon. When you spawn in the first player to join can select the weapon to be used via a menu - then everyone uses that gun.

Make sure to disable all weapons! This could be updated now to make sure noone spawns in with any weapons - maybe I will do that at some point!?
